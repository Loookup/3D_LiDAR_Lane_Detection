Lane Detection with 3D LiDAR

3D LiDAR based Lane Detection


In autonomous driving, as known as self-driving, it requires a lot of technologies, especially perceiving near environment and extracting proper information is most important part. Camera and LiDAR are commonly used for perception and each has different advantages and disadvantages. Camera has a lot of information, so we can extract colors, detect objects, track object, etc.. But with monocular, there’s no way to get the distance between desired object and camera. But LiDAR gives exact distance and shape of object. Also, LiDAR gives robust data compare with camera in bad weather. So, if you want to detect lane in road, LiDAR might be better option, because you can easily detect lane. Therefore, that’s why intensity is critical value in lane detection when using LiDAR.
